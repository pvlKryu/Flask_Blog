# Flask_Blog
Blog development tutorial project and using the Flask Python framework 
<br>
<br>
To implement the project, I chose the Flask framework for the Python programming language. For database administration - Flask-SQLAlchemy library. Frontend development was carried out using the Bootstrap library (HTML, JS, CSS). The interface is cross-platform and adaptively displayed both on any personal computer and mobile device (the functionality is preserved). After development, the web service was uploaded to the server using the SSH remote connection technology - an application-level network protocol that allows remote control of the operating system. During the development process, the GIT version control system was used.

As part of the course work, it is required to develop a software tool for the security department, representing a database and an interface (web service). In order for the security department to function fully and productively, it is necessary to solve a number of the following tasks:
<br>
• storage, editing, search and deletion of protection agreements and drafting of new agreements;
<br>
• storage, editing, search and deletion of audit reports and drawing up new reports;
<br>
• automated preparation of the necessary reports for the director and the client;
<br>
• output of documents (reports) for printing.
